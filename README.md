# Programming in Ruby Curriculum

This project contains curriculum for teaching programming using Ruby with additional emphasize on building strong fundamental aspects, such as: critical thinking, problem solving and object-oriented concept. This course also cover some design and architectural topics and useful tools and libraries.

Ruby is used because of its human-centered nature and gentle learning curve. However, it must be noted by the mentors that they also have to teach the students to become language-agnostic, instead of depending to one particular language.

Approximate time needed for completing this course is 10-12 weeks.

## Notes For Mentor

1. Have good understanding of UNIX-based operating system
2. Understand and have experience using Ruby in professional setting for at least two years
3. Understand one programming language other than Ruby
4. Have excellent understanding of Object-oriented Programming
5. Fluent in English

### Preparation

1. Ensure that mentors have PC with Mac OS or Linux (preferred) as the operating system
2. Ensure that ruby is already installed. We can follow steps [here](https://rvm.io) to install Ruby using RVM
